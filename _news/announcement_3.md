#### AI Working Group
Under the Leadership of Provost Jackson the Artificial Intelligence Working Group was formed in 2023. This interdisciplinary initiative is aimed at leveraging the diverse expertise within our institution to advance in the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI). This group would focus on three primary objectives: professional development, policy formation, and groundbreaking research.

The establishment of this group aligns with our university's commitment to academic excellence and innovation. It provides a platform for our community to engage with AI in a meaningful way, preparing our students for future challenges and opportunities and positioning our faculty as leaders in this vital field.

#### Professional Development Committee
The working group will facilitate learning and knowledge-sharing events, workshops, and seminars. These activities aim to keep faculty, staff, and students abreast of the latest developments in AI, enhancing their professional skills and understanding of this critical field.
