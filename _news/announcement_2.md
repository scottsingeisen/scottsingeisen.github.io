Prof. Singeisen has been awarded the NCCU-Duke University Digital Humanities Course Development Fellowship. Sponsored by the Mellon Humanities Unbounded initiative at Duke University.

#### The Digital Eagles Nest
The Mellon fellowship will support the research and development of a new Digital Humanities (DH)
course for the NCCU DH minor that will additionally serve as an elective to all interested students from
the NCCU cohort. The envisioned course will blend architectural, cultural, and social histories in a crossdisciplinary
digital humanities project capturing the buildings of the NCCU campus, digitizing them, and
building a digital campus resource. The enrolled students will capture campus buildings with each
iteration of the course offering, adding to the digital campus with additional buildings, histories, and
institutional narratives. As an additional benefit, the course will further broaden the awareness of the
nascent architecture program created in the fall of 2023 both within the institution and beyond.

Akin to similarly successful DH projects which document historic architecture, campuses, and cities of
cultural and social importance such as <a href=https://buildingsouthbend.nd.edu>Building South Bend</a> and <a href=http://paris.cdh.ucla.edu>Paris: Past and Present</a>, The Digital
Eagles Nest will engage architectural humanities questions such as: Why is architecture essential to
human society, and what does architecture reflect about that society? How do individuals interact with the
space around them? What is the importance of the architectural campus to an HBCU? And how do we
assess the beauty of architecture?

The NCCU campus is rich in architectural history—eleven structures predating 1940 contribute to the
architectural heritage. Excluding three residences, these buildings adhere to the Georgian Revival style,
characterized by brick exteriors, symmetrical composition, and adherence to the proportions established
by classical Greek and Roman architecture as reinterpreted during the Renaissance period. Ornamental
features, typically drawing inspiration from the classical tradition, are often employed with restraint and
in some instances are entirely absent from exterior facades. Among these structures are the James E.
Shepard Administration Building, Alexander Dunn Hall, Annie Day Shepard Hall, and five institutional
buildings erected in the late 1930s under the Public Works Administration's auspices. Recognition of the
campus's historical significance culminated in its inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places in
1986. During the course development – as well as when offered – an important resource for the faculty
and students will be Mr. André Vann, coordinator of university archives. The university archives contain
a rich variety of documentary, photographic, and historic materials that will prove invaluable.

While the architectural history of NCCU is already special, the culture of campus is also important given
that the university is an HBCU. Cultural heritage encompasses the tangible and intangible legacies
inherited from past generations, serving as a crucial node between the historical and the contemporary. It
manifests not only in physical artifacts like campus architecture but also in the very fabric of traditions,
narratives, and social practices. This dynamic between the historic and contemporary will permit enrolled
students to understand their identities, values, and the narratives that shaped their campus, and in turn,
them. The intent is to foster recognition of the inherent value of this shared inheritance of the built
environment, whether the student’s campus or their hometown.

The Digital Eagles Nest can also capture important historical social activities as an additional layer of
information and data. Similar to the <a href= https://www.urbanarchive.nyc/>Urban Archive</a>, visitors to the future Digital Eagles Nest may find
themselves checking in daily to discover a social happening from that day in history, potentially learn
about a historical on-campus moment such as ‘The Secret Game’ in 1944, or reflect on a geo-located
photo of the Homecoming Court from the university archives.

The methodology of this course will be varied but must commence with the digitization of buildings from
the NCCU campus. It is my intent to initially begin with the James E. Shepard Administration Building as
the signature campus structure. By using techniques like 3D scanning, modeling, visualization,
photogrammetry, LiDAR, and even virtual reality, students can create comprehensive, accurate, and
efficient records of historic structures. These digital representations capture not only the physical form of
the buildings but also their historical context, construction details, and even intangible aspects like
cultural significance. Once a building is digitized, the building information can then be analyzed, and
additional layers of research and resources can be added to the digital architectural model including the
social and culture exhibits explained prior. This complete NCCU building can then be displayed and
disseminated to a wider audience on-line, helping to raise awareness, promote research, and ensure the
long-term preservation of these valuable structures.

The intended method of disseminating the materials is through a permanent online resource web space.
Dynamic and interactive, the Digital Eagles Nest can be accessed from anywhere in the world by
researchers, alumni, or interested future students. As each subsequent offering of the class occurs across
multiple semesters the students can capture additional buildings with each iteration and further expand the
Digital Eagles Nest. These results and output will be a record of the student’s investigation for resumes
and CVs, as well as a signature digital space that alumni of the course can return to over time to watch as
subsequent students continue to build out the Digital Eagles Nest.

An outcome of the fellowship, research, and affiliated outputs will be to increase knowledge of the
architectural, social, and culture history of the NCCU campus. Additionally, this supported DH endeavor
will become a seed for future funding opportunities at the local, state, and national level and can exist as a
model for universities and institutions. Promotion of the Digital Eagles Nest, writings, and papers will
assess the successes and areas of needed improvement to ensure future iterations of the course are
elevated.
